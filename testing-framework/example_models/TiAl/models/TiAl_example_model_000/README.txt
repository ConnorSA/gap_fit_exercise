in here we have/need the following:

model.py
TiAl.xml and related sparse files.
__pychace___ if this isn't here, it will be generated when you run the testing framework

Make sure the TiAl.xml is the potential you want to test. remember you can just make another folder with a different potential
if you want to keep old ones! 
Make sure that model.py is edited such that it is consistent with the directory. change the variable name to that of the folder
if your working in a new directory..
